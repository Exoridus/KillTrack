KillTrack
=========

KillTrack will keep track of how many times you've killed various mobs.

The main way to see this info is on tooltips. As you hover over any killable mob, the kill count will be displayed on the bottom of the tooltip.

There is also a friendly list that you can bring up to display **all** mobs with their NPC id, global kill count and kills on the current character.
Note that the list will only load 100 entries at a time due to lag issues.
Loading more than 200 entries will most certainly cause severe lag.

Kill Timer
----------

Ever wanted to track how many kills you accumulate within a certain time? You can do so with KillTrack.

You simply tell it how long to track, and a window will pop up listing number of kills, time left, kills per minute and kills per second.

Feedback
--------

If you have any suggestions, bug reports, complains et.c, please make a new issue here on GitHub.  
I would prefer if you use the Issues page here on GitHub instead of the ones on Curse/WoWInterface.
